# ML4

An anomaly detection was performed on two datasets using quartiles, IQR, Z-score, and box plots, histograms, and scatterplots. A linear regression model was trained on the 'airbnb.csv' dataset and PCA was applied to reduce the number of features, resulting in analysis and visualization of the number of features, time spent training, and accuracy. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was used to generate 2-dimensional real-valued data and the model order was selected using maximum likelihood parameter estimation and 10-fold cross-validation.
